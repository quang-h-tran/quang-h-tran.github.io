  title: "About Me"
  content: '<p class="lead">
    I am primarily interested in the migration and evolution of giant planetary systems.
    I also hunt for exoplanets using precision radial velocities from the ground and photometry from space.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
    My current research projects focus on searching for giant planets around young stars using precision radial velocities.
    I am also working on how best to model and ultimately mitigate stellar activity signals in astronomical time series data
    (particularly with Gaussian process regression).
    In general, I want to understand the underlying, population-level demographics of planets through probabilistic data analysis techniques.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
    When I<span>&#39;</span>m not doing research, I enjoy weightlifting, being bad at pool (always down for a game),
    and searching for the best boba milk tea (ask for recs!).

      description: '<b>One of my primary research interests is how the orbits of giant planets evolve over time.</b>
                    To answer this question, I am leading a 4-year precision radial velocity (PRV) survey
                    targeting <span>&#8776;</span>100 intermediate-age (~20-200 Myr) Sun-like (GK dwarf) stars with the
                    <a target="_blank" href="https://hpf.psu.edu/">Habitable-Zone Planet Finder (HPF)</a> spectrograph.
                    This survey will measure the occurrence rate of close-in (<2.5 AU) giant planets,
                    compare this value with the frequency at older ages, and determine the dominant
                    migration mechanism of giant planets and its characteristic timescale (see right!).
                    The first paper describing the survey design, data reduction pipeline, and initial results can be found below!'

      description: '<p class="lead">Another approach I take to this question is the characterization of systems hosting giant planets.
                    By performing detailed studies of systems with uncommon architectures, we can build a sample large enough to infer population-level statistics and trends.

                    <p class="lead">
                    One such system was TOI-1670, which hosted an inner Sub-Neptune and outer warm Jupiter (WJ) (see left).
                    The modest population of systems with this unique configuration all have near-zero orbital eccentricties,
                    whereas the eccentricities of other WJs are more widely distributed (see left), suggesting that these systems
                    may have formed and migrated along a similar evolutionary pathway. For more information, see the paper below!

      description: '<p class="lead">
                    Detection limits for low mass, Earth-sized planets and planets around young, active stars are increasingly dominated by intrinsic stellar variability.
                    To conduct population-level inference and detailed individual studies on these interesting systems,
                    <b>we need advanced methods that can distinguish non-dynamical variations from Keplerian motion.</b>

                    in photometry and RVs (right, top panel).
                    Then, I created a Gaussian process framework that simultaneously models stellar variability in both photometry and RVs. Using the synthetic dataset above,
